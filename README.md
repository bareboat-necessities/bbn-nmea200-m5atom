# N2K for M5Atom
N2K esp32 Arduino sketches for m5atom with can CAIS3050G based on:

- https://github.com/ttlappalainen/ 
- https://github.com/hatlabs/ 
- https://github.com/AK-Homberger 

works

## Wiring
Do not wire H and L N2K in opposite. Coloring on A5Atom CAN CAIS3050G is misleading.

- White N2K goes into blue (H) on m5atom CAIS3050G
- Blue N2K goes into green (L) on m5atom CAIS3050G
